In a 2014 interview for PEN America, Jones stated, “I’m obsessed with manhood as a brutal and artful performance. My mind always finds its way back to the crossroad where sex, race, and power collide. Journeys, transformation as well as dashed attempts to transform, fascinate me as well.”",

Our voices allow others to construct a mental image of us, including age, race and ethnicity, personality, and physical characteristics. Gender is an especially notable feature of the voice to which listeners are sensitive. Gender cues in speech are particularly important for trans and gender non-conforming individuals, whose voices may, at times, feel at odds with their gender orientation and identity. In this workshop we'll explore the many ways our identity is coded in our voices, how our ideas of ‚Äútypical‚Äù voices develop, strategies for working toward achieving an authentic voice, and the role of trans and non-binary identities in shaping the future of communication technology. After the presentation we will open to a round of discussion on our own experiences with voice and identity.",

Activists began to create terms to identify Queer people for the first time, institutes began to study gender and sexuality, and organizations began to gather to fight anti-Queer laws. Un-Erased will explore the foundations of this period of Queer German history, its dramatic end, and its influence on modern American activism and Queer identity. Participants will obtain an understanding of what it means to study Queer history, the daily life of Queer Germans through the rise of the Third Reich, and the lasting effects of this time period on modern Queer life.",

        "description": "Has anyone else noticed that recruitment materials from higher education institutions targeting LGBTQ+ students has increased dramatically in the last ten to twenty years? Campus Pride Index has become a common term on campus? Well, you're not alone. Many institutions have begun marketing and recruitment campaigns to bring LGBTQ+ students to their campuses and the number of Campus Pride Index profiles has increased exponentially over the years. However, admissions data for sexual orientation and gender identity has remained consistently nonexistent. Why is there such a disconnect between these two areas? How can we anecdotally notice a push for LGBTQ+ student admission and recruitment at institutions, yet institutions do not choose to collect data about their identities? During this presentation, I will explore how the concepts of rainbow capitalism, academic capitalism, and lack of institutional requirement for admission & recruitment data collection have all interacted within the industry of US higher education to lead us to our current situation... Institutions being able to recruit and admit larger and larger numbers of LGBTQ+ students each year, while simultaneously not being required to report these identity groups in which these students exist, therefore not \"outing\" themselves as supporting or hosting LGBTQ+ students to donors or other institutional supporters who would disagree or disapprove of such.",

In the 2000s, we saw marriage equality spring up in Democratic states, however we saw state constitutions amended to discriminate. Marriage equality was sought so heavily, not just because it was another plank in the queer movement, but because it conferred many rights with one movement, second-parent adoption, hospital visitation, inheritance, insurance dependency, and power of attorney. But as marriage became law, so did Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, bathroom bills, and adoption limitations. Where are we at now in Trump's America? How will the Supreme Court likely rule on the 3 cases presented on October 8, and what will that mean for us? Join in for a dialogue about where we came from and where we are going.",

From early days of trauma as a young gay man in a small town, Ben escaped to the city. He struggled to find a way to accept his sexuality and lifestyle. ENTER: Candi, Wantsome? Ben's alter ego was not just a drag queen, but a top entertainer in his big city community. But how to hide and cope with his mental health was still looming. After years onstage, he decided to work on his boy life and dove into the corporate world. Unknown to Ben, he had been taught by his own LGBTQ+ community how to celebrate, how to cope with sadness or even just a hectic day at work. He had been entrenched in a habit of using alcohol in excess, regularly. Everyone surrounding him was escaping through drinking. He knew the right people, attended the hottest social scenes, and ran with the hottest crowds but Ben's corporate image began to crack alongside his showgirl side, Candi. His depression was running him into the ground and his drinking was on overload. Life started to fall apart; losing jobs, health problems, and having a serious car accident totaling his car but not remembering. Attempting to get help at his family's request, Ben started to seek treatment only to relapse over and over. Ben packed up everything he could gather in two hours and left. At the age of 36, he traveled back to the small hometown setting and moved in with his parents. Still struggling, back in his small hometown Ben eventually crashed and was arrested, jailed, and things began to shift. Getting sober in the LGBTQ+ community is hard when we are conditioned to be those happy party rainbow people. The real journey began after Ben's sobriety and into his recovery when he asked himself: \"Where do I fit into my LGBTQ+ community anymore? A sober drag queen, does that exist?\" It does now, come hear a tale of glitter, pain, and finding where you fit in even when you're always standing out.",
